# SynthAssignment2

Code for tasks not listed below can be found in `Assignment.ipynb`.

1- I used the KORG Volca Beats and Electribe. I think my novice-level experience with MIDI interfaces and staying within the KORG family made it easy to make some simple beat/melody combinations.

3- The biggest catch in this task was getting my code to recognize the MIDI controller. I used the Mido library to make this connection and read note, velocity, and duration data.

7- Regardless of temperament, there were very present beats between the bass note and the 2nd-, 3rd-, and sometimes 4th-degree notes. Also, the even-numbered temperaments felt more harmonious than odd-numbered temperaments. However, I imagine this would be different if I had more experience with non-western modalities.
