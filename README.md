# SynthAssignment2

Code for tasks not listed below can be found in `Assignment.ipynb`.

1. I used the KORG Volca Beats and Electribe. I think my novice-level experience with MIDI interfaces and staying within the KORG family made it easy to make some simple beat/melody combinations.
3. The biggest catch in this task was getting my code to recognize the MIDI controller. I used the Mido library to make this connection and read note, velocity, and duration data.
